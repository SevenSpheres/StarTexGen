This is a program that generates star textures for use in [Celestia](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/Celestia) or whatever program you like.
It's still a work-in-progress and the code is pretty messy. To run it, you need
[Python](https://www.python.org/) 3, as well as the modules [noise](https://pypi.org/project/noise/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/),
[Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
